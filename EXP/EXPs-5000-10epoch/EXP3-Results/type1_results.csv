The image presents a grouped bar chart with two marked bars. The taller marked bar is on the left, and the shorter marked bar is on the right. To estimate the ratio of their heights, we can compare their positions relative to the scale.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

*   **Step 1:** Observe the scale on the y-axis, which ranges from 0 to 1.
*   **Step 2:** Identify the positions of the two marked bars on the y-axis.
*   **Step 3:** Compare the positions of the two marked bars to determine their heights relative to the scale.
*   **Step 4:** Estimate the ratio of the height of the shorter marked bar to the height of the taller marked bar.

The image presents a grouped bar chart with multiple bars, each representing a different category. The chart is divided into two sections, with the left side featuring three bars and the right side featuring four bars. The first bar on the left is the tallest, followed by the second bar, which is slightly shorter. The third bar is significantly shorter than the first two.

The first bar on the right is the tallest, followed by the second bar, which is slightly shorter. The third bar is also shorter than the first two, but not as short as the third bar on the left. The fourth bar is the shortest of all.

To estimate the ratio of the height of the shorter marked bar to the height of the taller marked bar, we can compare the heights of the bars visually. The shorter marked bar appears to be approximately one-third the height of the taller marked bar. Therefore, the ratio would be around 0.33 or 1:3.

The two marked bars in the grouped bar chart have heights that can be estimated as follows:

*   The shorter marked bar is approximately 0.3 units tall.
*   The taller marked bar is approximately 0.7 units tall.

To find the ratio of the heights, divide the height of the shorter bar by the height of the taller bar:

0.3 / 0.7 = 0.42857142857

This ratio can be approximated to 0.43.

Since the ratio is 0.375, we can convert it to a scale from 0 to 1 by dividing by the maximum value on the scale, which is 1. The ratio is approximately 0.375/1 = 0.375.

The image presents a grouped bar chart with multiple bars, each representing a different category. The chart is divided into two sections, with the left section featuring four bars and the right section featuring five bars. The bars are arranged in a way that the taller bar is located on the right side of the chart.

To compare the heights of the two marked bars, we need to analyze their positions relative to each other. The shorter marked bar is situated on the left side of the chart, while the taller marked bar is located on the right side. By visually inspecting the chart, we can estimate the ratio of the height of the shorter marked bar to the height of the taller marked bar.

Based on the visual inspection, it appears that the shorter marked bar is approximately 0.5 times the height of the taller marked bar. This indicates that the shorter marked bar is half the height of the taller marked bar.
