**Step 1: Identify the lengths of the segments.**

The shorter segment has a length of 3 units, and the taller segment has a length of 5 units.

**Step 2: Calculate the ratio.**

To find the ratio of the shorter segment's length to the taller segment's length, divide the length of the shorter segment by the length of the taller segment.

Ratio = Length of shorter segment / Length of taller segment
= 3 / 5
= 0.6

**Step 3: Convert the ratio to a scale from 0 to 1.**

Since the ratio is already between 0 and 1, no conversion is needed.

**Step 1: Analyze the image**

The image shows a mixed divided stacked bar chart. The chart consists of two bars, one on the left and one on the right. The left bar has two marked segments, while the right bar has four marked segments.

**Step 2: Compare the lengths of the segments**

The left bar has two segments, with the shorter segment being approximately 2/5 of the height of the taller segment.

**Step 3: Calculate the ratio**

The ratio of the shorter segment's length to the taller segment's length is 2/5 or approximately 0.4.
