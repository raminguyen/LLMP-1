The volume of a cube is calculated by multiplying its side length by itself three times. In this case, the image is 100 units on each side, so the volume would be:

100 x 100 x 100 = 1,000,000

To estimate the cube volume, we need to determine the length of one side of the cube. Based on the given image, the side length appears to be approximately 10 units.

* Volume = side length^3
* Volume = 10^3
* Volume = 1000

**Step 1: Estimate the cube volume.**

*   The cube is a small, three-dimensional shape with equal sides.

*   The cube is about 1/10 the size of the image.

*   The volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the length of one side.
