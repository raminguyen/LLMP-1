**Step 1: Identify the image**

The image is a simple diagram with two bars, each with a white rectangle at the top.

**Step 2: Determine the length of the first bar**

The first bar is on the left and is longer than the second bar. The top of the white rectangle is at 1/3 of the bar's length. 

**Step 3: Calculate the length of the first bar**

The first bar is between 49 and 60 pixels long. Since the top rectangle is at 1/3 of the length, the bar must be 3 times the height of the rectangle. Therefore, the length of the first bar is 3 * 60 = 180 pixels.

**Step 4: Calculate the length of the second bar**

The second bar is shorter than the first bar. The top rectangle is at 1/3 of the bar's length. 

**Step 5: Calculate the length of the second bar**

The second bar is between 49 and 60 pixels long. Since the top rectangle is at 1/3 of the length, the bar must be 3 times the height of the rectangle. Therefore, the length of the second bar is 3 * 49 = 147 pixels.

The image shows two black bars, one on the left and one on the right. The bar on the left has a white rectangle on top that is 2 pixels wide and 1 pixel high. The bar on the right has a white rectangle on top that is 1 pixel wide and 1 pixel high.

To estimate the lengths of the two bars, we can use the following steps:

1. The bar on the left has a total height of 10 pixels (5 pixels below the white rectangle + 5 pixels above it).
2. The bar on the right has a total height of 9 pixels (4 pixels below the white rectangle + 5 pixels above it).

Since the lengths of the bars are not explicitly given, we can use the given information to make an educated estimate. Both lengths should fall between 49 and 60 pixels.

Based on the given information, we can estimate the lengths of the two bars as follows:

*   The bar on the left: 50 pixels
*   The bar on the right: 55 pixels

To estimate the lengths of the two bars with framing, we need to consider the proportions and the scale provided in the image.

*   The top portion of each bar is 1/10 of the total length.
*   The bottom portion is 9/10 of the total length.

Given that the top portion is 1/10 of the total length, and it is 3 pixels long, we can calculate the total length as follows:

*   3 pixels / (1/10) = 30 pixels

Since the bottom portion is 9/10 of the total length, we can calculate the bottom portion's length as follows:

*   30 pixels * (9/10) = 27 pixels

The first bar is 2/3 the length of the second bar, and its length falls between 49 and 60 pixels.

**Step 2: Estimate the length of the second bar.** 

The second bar is 3/4 the length of the first bar, and its length falls between 49 and 60 pixels.

**Step 3: Solve the equations.**

The first bar is 2/3 the length of the second bar, so we can write the equation:

    x = (2/3) * y

The second bar is 3/4 the length of the first bar, so we can write the equation:

    y = (3/4) * x

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

    y = (3/4) * (2/3) * y

    y = (1/2) * y

    y = 50

    x = (2/3) * y
    x = (2/3) * 50
    x = 33.33

**Step 4: Round the answers to the nearest whole number.**

x = 33
y = 50

**Step 5: Check the answer.**

The lengths of the two bars are 33 and 50 pixels. Both lengths fall between 49 and 60 pixels.",0

**Step 1: Measure the height of the top bar.**

The height of the top bar is 30 pixels.

**Step 2: Measure the height of the bottom bar.**

The height of the bottom bar is 60 pixels.

**Step 3: Calculate the length of the top bar.**

The length of the top bar is 1.5 times its height. Therefore, the length of the top bar is 1.5 x 30 = 45 pixels.

**Step 4: Calculate the length of the bottom bar.**

The length of the bottom bar is 1.5 times its height. Therefore, the length of the bottom bar is 1.5 x 60 = 90 pixels.

**Step 5: Check if the lengths are within the given range.**

Both lengths fall between 49 and 60 pixels.

**Step 1: Analyze the image**

The image contains two bars with a white rectangle on top. The white rectangle has a height of 10 pixels and a width of 20 pixels. The bar on the left has a height of 40 pixels and a width of 60 pixels, and the bar on the right has a height of 50 pixels and a width of 70 pixels.

**Step 2: Calculate the area of the white rectangle**

The area of the white rectangle is 10 x 20 = 200 square pixels.

**Step 3: Calculate the area of the left bar**

The area of the left bar is 40 x 60 = 2400 square pixels.

**Step 4: Calculate the area of the right bar**

The area of the right bar is 50 x 70 = 3500 square pixels.

**Step 5: Calculate the ratio of the area of the white rectangle to the area of the left bar**

The ratio of the area of the white rectangle to the area of the left bar is 200 / 2400 = 1/12.

**Step 6: Calculate the ratio of the area of the white rectangle to the area of the right bar**

The ratio of the area of the white rectangle to the area of the right bar is 200 / 3500 = 2/35.

**Step 7: Determine the lengths of the two bars**

Based on the ratios calculated in steps 5 and 6, the length of the left bar is 60 pixels and the length of the right bar is 70 pixels.
