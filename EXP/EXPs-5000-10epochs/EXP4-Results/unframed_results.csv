The image depicts two black bars against a white background. The first bar is slightly longer than the second bar. To estimate their lengths, we can compare them to the number of pixels in the image.

*   The first bar is approximately 55 pixels long.
*   The second bar is approximately 50 pixels long.

**Step 1: Analyze the image**

The image shows two black bars on a white background. The bars are symmetrical, with one bar on the left and one bar on the right.

**Step 2: Determine the lengths of the bars**

To estimate the lengths of the bars, we need to consider their width and height. The height of the bars is the same as the height of the image, which is 60 pixels.

**Step 3: Calculate the lengths of the bars**

Since the bars are symmetrical, we can assume that the lengths of the bars are equal. To find the length of each bar, we need to divide the total width of the image by 2. The total width of the image is 60 pixels, so the length of each bar is 30 pixels.

**Step 4: Answer the question**
