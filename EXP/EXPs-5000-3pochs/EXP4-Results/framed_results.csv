**Step 1: Analyze the image**

The image shows two bars of equal length. The left bar is 2 pixels shorter than the right bar. The left bar is 49 pixels long, and the right bar is 60 pixels long.

**Step 2: Calculate the lengths**

The difference between the two bars is 60 - 49 = 11 pixels. To find the lengths of the two bars, we can subtract 11 from the longer bar and add 11 to the shorter bar.

**Step 3: Calculate the lengths of the two bars**

The lengths of the two bars are 49 + 11 = 60 pixels and 60 - 11 = 49 pixels.

**Step 1: Estimate the length of the left bar.** The left bar is roughly 3/4 the length of the right bar. The right bar is roughly 60 pixels. So, the left bar is approximately 60 x 3/4 = 45 pixels.

**Step 2: Estimate the length of the right bar.** The left bar is roughly 1/2 the length of the right bar. So, the right bar is approximately 45 x 2 = 90 pixels.

**Step 3: Check the length of the right bar.** The right bar is 90 pixels, which is not between 49 and 60 pixels.

**Step 4: Estimate the length of the right bar again.** The right bar is roughly 4/3 the length of the left bar. So, the right bar is approximately 45 x 4/3 = 60 pixels.

**Step 5: Check the length of the right bar again.** The right bar is 60 pixels, which is between 49 and 60 pixels.

**Step 6: Check the length of the left bar again.** The left bar is 45 pixels, which is between 49 and 60 pixels.

**Step 1: Analyze the image**

The image shows two bars with a white section at the top. We can see that the white section is 4 pixels long on both bars.

**Step 2: Determine the length of the white section**

The length of the white section is 4 pixels.

**Step 3: Calculate the length of the first bar**

To calculate the length of the first bar, we need to subtract the length of the white section from the total length. The total length is 60 pixels. Subtracting the length of the white section (4 pixels) from the total length (60 pixels) gives us:

60 - 4 = 56

So, the length of the first bar is 56 pixels.

**Step 4: Calculate the length of the second bar**

To calculate the length of the second bar, we need to subtract the length of the white section from the total length. The total length is 49 pixels. Subtracting the length of the white section (4 pixels) from the total length (49 pixels) gives us:

49 - 4 = 45

So, the length of the second bar is 45 pixels.

**Step 1: Determine the length of the bar on the left**

*   The bar on the left is 2 pixels longer than the bar on the right.

**Step 2: Determine the length of the bar on the right**

*   The bar on the right is 1 pixel longer than the bar on the left.

**Step 3: Calculate the length of the bar on the right**

*   The bar on the right is 1 pixel longer than the bar on the left, which is 2 pixels longer than the bar on the right. So the bar on the right is 1 + 2 = 3 pixels longer than the bar on the right.

**Step 4: Calculate the length of the bar on the right**

*   The bar on the right is 3 pixels longer than the bar on the right, which is 1 pixel longer than the bar on the left. So the bar on the right is 3 + 1 = 4 pixels longer than the bar on the left.

**Step 5: Calculate the length of the bar on the right**

*   The bar on the right is 4 pixels longer than the bar on the left, which is 2 pixels longer than the bar on the right. So the bar on the right is 4 + 2 = 6 pixels longer than the bar on the right.

**Step 6: Calculate the length of the bar on the right**

*   The bar on the right is 6 pixels longer than the bar on the right, which is 1 pixel longer than the bar on the left. So the bar on the right is 6 + 1 = 7 pixels longer than the bar on the left.

**Step 7: Calculate the length of the bar on the right**

*   The bar on the right is 7 pixels longer than the bar on the left, which is 2 pixels longer than the bar on the right. So the bar on the right is 7 + 2 = 9 pixels longer than the bar on the right.

**Step 1: Measure the width of the bars.** The width of the left bar is 18 pixels and the width of the right bar is 20 pixels.

**Step 3: Multiply the ratio by the desired length of the left bar.** The desired length of the left bar is 49 pixels. 49 * 9 = 441 pixels.
