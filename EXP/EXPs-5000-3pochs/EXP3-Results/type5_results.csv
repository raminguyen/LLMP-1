**Step 1: Identify the segments in the bar chart.**

The two segments are the shorter segment and the taller segment.

**Step 2: Compare the lengths of the two segments.**

The shorter segment is about 3/4 the length of the taller segment.

**Step 3: Calculate the ratio of the shorter segment's length to the taller segment's length.**

The ratio is 3/4 or 0.75.
