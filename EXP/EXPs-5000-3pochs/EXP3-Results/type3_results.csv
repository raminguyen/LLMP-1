The two marked bars in the grouped bar chart are the second bar in the second group and the first bar in the last group. The second bar in the second group is the shorter of the two marked bars. The first bar in the last group is the taller of the two marked bars.

To estimate the ratio of the heights of the two bars, we can use the scale from 0 to 1. The scale indicates that 1 represents equal height, so a ratio of 0 would indicate that the shorter bar is much shorter than the taller bar, and a ratio of 1 would indicate that the two bars are of equal height.

Based on the chart, the shorter marked bar appears to be about one-third the height of the taller marked bar. Therefore, the estimated ratio of the shorter marked bar's height to the taller marked bar's height is approximately 0.33.",0

To compare the heights of the two marked bars and estimate the ratio of the shorter marked bar's height to the taller marked bar's height, we can analyze the chart as follows:

1. **Identify the marked bars**: The chart shows several bars representing different categories. Two of these bars are marked with dots. 

2. **Compare the heights**: Visually inspecting the chart, the marked bar on the left appears shorter than the marked bar on the right.

3. **Estimate the ratio**: Given the visual comparison, the height of the shorter marked bar seems to be roughly half the height of the taller marked bar. This is a subjective estimation based on the visual inspection.

4. **Scale**: The scale provided is from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates equal height. Since the shorter bar is estimated to be half the height of the taller bar, its ratio would be 0.5 on this scale.

To compare the heights of the two marked bars and estimate the ratio of the shorter marked bar's height to the taller marked bar's height, we can use the following steps:

1. **Observe the Chart**: The chart shows a grouped bar chart with several bars of varying heights.

2. **Identify the Marked Bars**: We need to locate the two marked bars in the chart. The chart does not provide explicit labels for the bars, but based on the visual cues, we can identify the two marked bars as the ones on the far right and the second from the right in the first group.

3. **Estimate the Heights**: By visually inspecting the chart, we can estimate the heights of the two marked bars relative to each other and to the scale provided.

4. **Calculate the Ratio**: Without exact measurements, we can estimate the ratio based on the visual comparison. Given the scale from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates equal height, we can estimate the ratio of the shorter marked bar's height to the taller marked bar's height.

To determine the ratio of the heights of the two marked bars, we need to compare their values.

**Step 1: Identify the heights of the marked bars**

The shorter marked bar has a height of approximately 2 units, while the taller marked bar has a height of approximately 4 units.

**Step 2: Calculate the ratio**

To find the ratio, divide the height of the shorter marked bar by the height of the taller marked bar:

Ratio = Height of shorter marked bar / Height of taller marked bar
= 2 / 4
= 0.5
