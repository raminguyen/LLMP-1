To estimate the ratio of their heights, we can compare their relative positions on the scale.\\n\\n*   The shorter marked bar is approximately 0.2 units high.\\n*   The taller marked bar is approximately 0.8 units high.\\n\\n**Step 2: Calculate the ratio**\\n\\nTo find the ratio of the heights, we divide the height of the shorter bar by the height of the taller bar:\\n\\nRatio = Height of shorter bar / Height of taller bar\\n= 0.2 / 0.8\\n= 0.25\\n\\n**Step 3: Convert the ratio to a scale from 0 to 1**\\n\\nSince the ratio is 0.25, we can convert it to a scale from 0 to 1 by multiplying it by 4:\\n\\nRatio (scale) = Ratio x 4\\n= 0.25 x 4\\n= 1\\n\\n**Answer**: 0.25   \n",
